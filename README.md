# Mod-3-Assignment-1

Basically just the product of the SASS tutorial posted on Slack. The features I found useful were:
Variables, 
Nesting, 
Mixins (although I'm still figuring out how to use Mixins correctly), 
being able to split your scss into different files and then call them into your main scss file. 
The debug function
Maths - adjusting values like colors using maths.
